This thesis should include a CD containing supplementary data for chapters 2 and 3. This CD contains two files in Excel format.

Chapter2.xls contains the complete results of the TraDIS assays described in chapter 2, and should be identical to the supplementary information of \textcite{Barquist2013a}.

Chapter3.xls contains genomic features significantly depleted or enriched in insertions over the macrophage assays described in chapter 3.

If the CD is not enclosed, or if you are viewing this thesis electronically, contact Lars Barquist (lb14@sanger.ac.uk) to obtain these files.
