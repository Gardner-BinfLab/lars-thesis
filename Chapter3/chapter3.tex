\textit{This chapter is a modified version of the previously published article ``A comparison of dense transposon insertion libraries in the \emph{Salmonella} serovars Typhi and Typhimurium'' \parencite{Barquist2013a}. This work is a result of collaboration with Gemma C. Langridge (Pathogen Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), who constructed the \emph{Salmonella} Typhimurium transposon mutant library and contributed to a draft manuscript. In particular, portions of sections 2.3.1-3 have their genesis in \textcite{Langridge2010}, though have been significantly elaborated on here.}
