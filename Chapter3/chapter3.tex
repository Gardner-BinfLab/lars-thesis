\textit{Section 3.3 describes a collaborative study with Gemma C. Langridge (Pathogen Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute). Gemma performed all laboratory experiments described in this chapter.}

\section{Introduction}

In the previous chapter, I described the results of a study predicting and comparing the genes required for robust growth of two \textit{Salmonella} serovars in standard laboratory media. This study
