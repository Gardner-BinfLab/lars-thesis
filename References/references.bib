@article{Achtman1999,
	Abstract = {Plague, one of the most devastating diseases of human history, is
	caused by Yersinia pestis. In this study, we analyzed the population
	genetic structure of Y. pestis and the two other pathogenic Yersinia
	species, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica. Fragments of
	five housekeeping genes and a gene involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide
	were sequenced from 36 strains representing the global diversity
	of Y. pestis and from 12-13 strains from each of the other species.
	No sequence diversity was found in any Y. pestis gene, and these
	alleles were identical or nearly identical to alleles from Y. pseudotuberculosis.
	Thus, Y. pestis is a clone that evolved from Y. pseudotuberculosis
	1,500-20,000 years ago, shortly before the first known pandemics
	of human plague. Three biovars (Antiqua, Medievalis, and Orientalis)
	have been distinguished by microbiologists within the Y. pestis clone.
	These biovars form distinct branches of a phylogenetic tree based
	on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the locations of
	the IS100 insertion element. These data are consistent with previous
	inferences that Antiqua caused a plague pandemic in the sixth century,
	Medievalis caused the Black Death and subsequent epidemics during
	the second pandemic wave, and Orientalis caused the current plague
	pandemic.},

	for respiratory disease was associated with subsequent adverse health
	outcomes. Feces were collected per rectum from cattle that were examined
	for apparent respiratory disease, had a rectal temperature > or =
	40 degrees C, and subsequently received antimicrobial treatment.
	Salmonella were recovered from 918 (73.7%) of 1 245 fecal samples
	and weekly prevalence estimates ranged from 49 to 100% over the 3-month
	study. Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of Salmonella strains
	in the population were determined. Serogroup E Salmonella were most
	common (73.3%), followed by C1 (11.0%), C3 (8.6%), and B (1.1%).
	Predominant serotypes were Orion (46.5%), Anatum (19.8%), Kentucky
	(8.7%), Montevideo (7.5%), and Senftenberg (4.9%). Few isolates (36/918)
	were positive for antimicrobial resistance-associated integron gene
	intI1. Phenotypic susceptibility was associated with isolate intI1
	status. Crude re-pull, re-treatment and case fatality risks were
	higher for cattle that were Salmonella-positive versus -negative
	at initial treatment, but not statistically different on multivariable
	analysis. However, case fatality risk was higher for cattle shedding
	Group B Salmonella than for cattle shedding other serogroups. Lots
	(groups) with a higher Salmonella prevalence at first treatment had
	a higher proportion of mortalities occur in a hospital pen, higher
	overall re-treatment risks, and were more likely to be sampled later
	in the study. Results indicate a high prevalence of Salmonella in
	this population of cattle treated for apparent respiratory disease,
	but that effects associated with clinical outcomes may depend on
	the Salmonella strain.},

	DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons,
	a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements

	be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak

	hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments,
	yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times
	the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for
	automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced
	by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the
	database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated
	BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per

@article{Antal2005,
	Abstract = {A small noncoding bacterial ribonucleic acid of 62-64 nucleotides,
	RydC, was identified in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Salmonella,
	and Shigella. In vivo, RydC binds to the RNA-binding protein Hfq,
	and it is unstable when Hfq is absent. Mobility assays reveal that
	complex formation between RydC and Hfq is specific, with an apparent
	binding constant of approximately 300 nm. Sequence alignments combined
	with structural probing demonstrate that RydC folds as a pseudoknot.
	Hfq binds the loops crossing the deep and shallow grooves of the
	pseudoknotted RNA and reorganizes its overall conformation. An interaction
	with a polycistronic mRNA, yejABEF, which encodes a putative ABC
	transporter, was detected by affinity purification of immobilized
	RNA-Hfq complexes. In vivo, the yejABEF operon is expressed on minimal
	medium. Remarkably, its expression is reduced when RydC is absent,
	and the operon is degraded when RydC expression is stimulated. This
	observation correlates with the growth defects associated with a
	stimulation of its expression in vivo, generating a thermosensitive
	phenotype that affects growth on minimal media supplemented with
	glycerol, maltose, or ribose. We conclude that RydC regulates the
	yejABEF-encoded ABC permease at the mRNA level. This small RNA may
	contribute to optimal adaptation of some Enterobacteria to environmental

@article{Argaman2012,
	Abstract = {The conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq and its associated small regulatory
	RNAs (sRNAs) are increasingly recognized as the players of a large
	network of posttranscriptional control of gene expression in Gram-negative
	bacteria. The role of Hfq in this network is to facilitate base pairing
	between sRNAs and their trans-encoded target mRNAs. Although the
	number of known sRNA-mRNA interactions has grown steadily, cellular
	factors that influence Hfq, the mediator of these interactions, have
	remained unknown. We report that RelA, a protein long known as the
	central regulator of the bacterial-stringent response, acts on Hfq
	and thereby affects the physiological activity of RyhB sRNA as a
	regulator of iron homeostasis. RyhB requires RelA in vivo to arrest
	growth during iron depletion and to down-regulate a subset of its
	target mRNAs (fdoG, nuoA, and sodA), whereas the sodB and sdhC targets
	are barely affected by RelA. In vitro studies with recombinant proteins
	show that RelA enhances multimerization of Hfq monomers and stimulates
	Hfq binding of RyhB and other sRNAs. Hfq from polysomes extracted
	from wild-type cells binds RyhB in vitro, whereas Hfq from polysomes
	of a relA mutant strain shows no binding. We propose that, by increasing
	the level of the hexameric form of Hfq, RelA enables binding of RNAs
	whose affinity for Hfq is low. Our results suggest that, under specific
	conditions and/or environments, Hfq concentrations are limiting for
	RNA binding, which thereby provides an opportunity for cellular proteins
	such as RelA to impact sRNA-mediated responses by modulating the
	activity of Hfq.},

@article{Aseev2008,
	Abstract = {Autogenous regulation is a general strategy of balancing ribosomal
	protein synthesis in bacteria. Control mechanisms have been studied
	in detail for most of ribosomal protein operons, except for rpsB-tsf
	encoding essential r-protein S2 and elongation factor Ts, where even
	the promoter has remained unknown. By using single-copy translational
	fusions with the chromosomal lacZ gene and Western-blot analysis,
	we demonstrate here that S2 serves as a negative regulator of both
	rpsB and tsf expression in vivo, acting at a single target within
	the rpsB 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). As determined by primer
	extension, transcription of the Escherichia coli rpsB-tsf operon
	starts 162 nucleotides upstream of the rpsB initiation codon at a
	single promoter TGTGGTATAAA belonging to the extended -10 promoter
	class. Both the promoter signature and the 5'-UTR structure of the
	rpsB gene appear to be highly conserved in gamma-proteobacteria.
	Deletion analysis of the rpsB 5'-UTR within rpsB'-'lacZ fusions has
	revealed that an operator region involved in the S2 autoregulation
	comprises conserved structural elements located upstream of the rpsB
	ribosome binding site. The S2-mediated autogenous control is impaired
	in rpsB mutants and, more surprisingly, in the rpsA mutant producing

	by presenting a monophosphate group at the 5'-end of the cognate-pairing
	"seed." Moreover, in the absence of the target the 5'-monophosphate
	makes the sRNA seed region vulnerable to an attack by RNase E against

	years ago, yet have very different host ranges and pathogenicity.
	Despite the availability of multiple whole-genome sequences, the
	genetic differences that have driven these changes in phenotype are
	only beginning to be understood. In this study, we use transposon-directed
	insertion-site sequencing to probe differences in gene requirements
	for competitive growth in rich media between these two closely related
	serovars. We identify a conserved core of 281 genes that are required
	for growth in both serovars, 228 of which are essential in Escherichia
	coli. We are able to identify active prophage elements through the
	requirement for their repressors. We also find distinct differences
	in requirements for genes involved in cell surface structure biogenesis
	and iron utilization. Finally, we demonstrate that transposon-directed
	insertion-site sequencing is not only applicable to the protein-coding
	content of the cell but also has sufficient resolution to generate
	hypotheses regarding the functions of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as
	well. We are able to assign probable functions to a number of cis-regulatory
	ncRNA elements, as well as to infer likely differences in trans-acting
	ncRNA regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Riboswitches are noncoding RNA structures that appropriately
	regulate genes in response to changing cellular conditions. The expression
	of many proteins involved in fundamental metabolic processes is controlled
	by riboswitches that sense relevant small molecule ligands. Metabolite-binding
	riboswitches that recognize adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), thiamin pyrophosphate
	(TPP), lysine, glycine, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), guanine, adenine,
	glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P), 7-aminoethyl 7-deazaguanine (preQ1),
	and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) have been reported. RESULTS: We have
	used covariance model searches to identify examples of ten widespread
	riboswitch classes in the genomes of organisms from all three domains
	of life. This data set rigorously defines the phylogenetic distributions
	of these riboswitch classes and reveals how their gene control mechanisms
	vary across different microbial groups. By examining the expanded
	aptamer sequence alignments resulting from these searches, we have
	also re-evaluated and refined their consensus secondary structures.
	Updated riboswitch structure models highlight additional RNA structure
	motifs, including an unusual double T-loop arrangement common to
	AdoCbl and FMN riboswitch aptamers, and incorporate new, sometimes
	noncanonical, base-base interactions predicted by a mutual information
	analysis. CONCLUSION: Riboswitches are vital components of many genomes.
	The additional riboswitch variants and updated aptamer structure
	models reported here will improve future efforts to annotate these
	widespread regulatory RNAs in genomic sequences and inform ongoing
	structural biology efforts. There remain significant questions about
	what physiological and evolutionary forces influence the distributions
	and mechanisms of riboswitches and about what forms of regulation
	substitute for riboswitches that appear to be missing in certain
	lineages.},

@article{Blondel2009,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recently described Type VI Secretion System (T6SS)
	represents a new paradigm of protein secretion in bacteria. A number
	of bioinformatic studies have been conducted to identify T6SS gene
	clusters in the available bacterial genome sequences. According to
	these studies, Salmonella harbors a unique T6SS encoded in the Salmonella
	Pathogenicity Island 6 (SPI-6). Since these studies only considered
	few Salmonella genomes, the present work aimed to identify novel
	T6SS loci by in silico analysis of every genome sequence of Salmonella
	available. RESULTS: The analysis of sequencing data from 44 completed
	or in progress Salmonella genome projects allowed the identification
	of 3 novel T6SS loci. These clusters are located in differentially-distributed
	genomic islands we designated SPI-19, SPI-20 and SPI-21, respectively.
	SPI-19 was identified in a subset of S. enterica serotypes including
	Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona, Gallinarum and Enteritidis. In the later,
	an internal deletion eliminated most of the island. On the other
	hand, SPI-20 and SPI-21 were restricted to S. enterica subspecies
	arizonae (IIIa) serotype 62:z4,z23:-. Remarkably, SPI-21 encodes
	a VgrG protein containing a C-terminal extension similar to S-type
	pyocins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is not only the first evolved
	VgrG described in Salmonella, but also the first evolved VgrG including
	a pyocin domain described so far in the literature. In addition,
	the data indicate that SPI-6 T6SS is widely distributed in S. enterica
	and absent in serotypes Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Agona, Javiana,
	Paratyphi B, Virchow, IIIa 62:z4,z23:- and IIIb 61:1,v:1,5,(7). Interestingly,
	while some serotypes harbor multiple T6SS (Dublin, Weltvreden and
	IIIa 62:z4,z23:-) others do not encode for any (Enteritidis, Paratyphi
	B, Javiana, Virchow and IIIb 61:1,v:1,5,(7)). Comparative and phylogenetic
	analyses indicate that the 4 T6SS loci in Salmonella have a distinct
	evolutionary history. Finally, we identified an orphan Hcp-like protein
	containing the Hcp/COG3157 domain linked to a C-terminal extension.
	We propose to designate this and related proteins as "evolved Hcps".
	CONCLUSION: Altogether, our data suggest that (i) the Salmonella
	T6SS loci were acquired by independent lateral transfer events and
	(ii) evolved to contribute in the adaptation of the serotypes to
	different lifestyles and environments, including animal hosts. Notably,
	the presence of an evolved VgrG protein related to pyocins suggests
	a novel role for T6SS in bacterial killing. Future studies on the
	roles of the identified T6SS loci will expand our knowledge on Salmonella
	pathogenesis and host specificity.},

	Abstract = {In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, activation of sigma(E)-dependent
	envelope stress response leads to the abrupt decline in the synthesis
	of all major outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Recent studies found
	that two sigma(E)-controlled small RNAs (sRNAs), MicA and RybB, downregulate
	a number of OMPs. While RybB targets several different mRNAs, including
	ompC and ompD, MicA was up to date thought to act solely on ompA.
	Here we present evidence showing that MicA downregulates a second
	Salmonella OMP: LamB maltoporine. In strains overexpressing sigma(E),
	MicA accumulation leads to a significant decrease in LamB protein
	and mRNA levels, as well as a reduction in beta-galactosidase activity
	in a strain carrying a lamB-lacZ translational fusion. The latter
	findings provided the basis for a genetic screen that allowed isolating
	point mutations in the micA gene and in its sigma(E) promoter. All
	alleles obtained displayed their altered regulatory phenotype from
	their natural chromosomal location. LamB downregulation by MicA requires
	a functional Hfq protein. Besides this role, confined to sigma(E)-activated
	conditions, we show that loss of Hfq results in the accumulation
	of a lamB-malM dimeric precursor and of malM mRNA during unchallenged
	growth. This suggests that Hfq normally intervenes in a mechanism
	that uncouples expression of the malK-lamB-malM operon, causing the
	distal portion of the transcript to be clipped off and degraded.},

@article{Briani2001,
	Abstract = {P4 is a natural phasmid (phage-plasmid) that exploits different modes
	of propagation in its host Escherichia coli. Extracellularly, P4
	is a virion, with a tailed icosahedral head, which encapsidates the
	11.6-kb-long double-stranded DNA genome. After infection of the E.
	coli host, P4 DNA can integrate into the bacterial chromosome and
	be maintained in a repressed state (lysogeny). Alternatively, P4
	can replicate as a free DNA molecule; this leads to either the lytic
	cycle or the plasmid state, depending on the presence or absence
	of the genome of a helper phage P2 in the E. coli host. As a phage,
	P4 is thus a satellite of P2 phage, depending on the helper genes
	for all the morphogenetic functions, whereas for all its episomal
	functions (integration and immunity, multicopy plasmid replication)
	P4 is completely autonomous from the helper. Replication of P4 DNA
	depends on its alpha protein, a multifunctional polypeptide that
	exhibits primase and helicase activity and binds specifically the
	P4 origin. Replication starts from a unique point, ori1, and proceeds
	bidirectionally in a straight theta-type mode. P4 negatively regulates
	the plasmid copy number at several levels. An unusual mechanism of
	copy number control is based on protein-protein interaction: the
	P4-encoded Cnr protein interacts with the alpha gene product, inhibiting
	its replication potential. Furthermore, expression of the replication
	genes cnr and alpha is regulated in a complex way that involves modulation
	of promoter activity by positive and negative factors and multiple
	mechanisms of transcription elongation-termination control. Thus,
	the relatively small P4 genome encodes mostly regulatory functions,
	required for its propagation both as an episomal element and as a
	temperate satellite phage. Plasmids that, like P4, propagate horizontally
	via a specific transduction mechanism have also been found in the
	Archaea. The presence of P4-like prophages or cryptic prophages often
	associated with accessory bacterial functions attests to the contribution
	of satellite phages to bacterial evolution.},

	notified in Germany between 1982 and 1997. In general, the methodological
	quality of testing was in line with internationally accepted guidelines.
	Bacterial gene mutation tests (Bact) were conducted for nearly all
	of the substances, 13.4% were positive. Of the Bact-positive substances,
	36 were also tested in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test (CAbvit)
	and the mammalian cell gene mutation test (MCGM). Twenty-six of these
	(72. 2%) were negative in both mammalian cell tests indicating that
	the genotoxic potentials of the substances are not relevant for man.
	Of all new substances, 333 were tested in CAbvit, here the percentage
	of positive findings was 25.2%. More than 80% of the in vitro clastogens
	were negative in the Bact. With respect to a sensitive detection

	is appropriate for basic testing. In our database CHL cells were
	more sensitive to clastogenic effects than other cell types. Only

	Each ExsA-dependent promoter contains two adjacent binding sites
	for monomeric ExsA. The promoter-proximal site (binding site 1) consists
	of highly conserved GnC and TGnnA sequences that are individually
	recognized by the two helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motifs of
	an ExsA monomer. While the GnC and TGnnA sequences are important
	for binding to site 1, the promoter-distal binding sites (site 2)
	lack obvious similarity among themselves or with binding site 1.
	In the present study, we demonstrate that site 2 in the P(exsC) promoter
	region contains a GnC sequence that is functionally equivalent to
	the GnC in site 1 and recognized by the first HTH motif of an ExsA
	monomer. Likewise, the second HTH interacts with an adenine residue

	present in site 2 of the P(exsD), P(exoT), and P(pcrG) promoters,
	the GnC sequences were not required for ExsA-dependent transcription

@article{Clayton2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica is a facultative intracellular pathogen
	of worldwide importance. Over 2,500 serovars exist and infections
	in humans and animals may produce a spectrum of symptoms from enteritis
	to typhoid depending on serovar- and host-specific factors. S. Enteritidis
	is the most prevalent non-typhoidal serovar isolated from humans
	with acute diarrhoeal illness in many countries. Human infections
	are frequently associated with direct or indirect contact with contaminated
	poultry meat or eggs owing to the ability of the organism to persist
	in the avian intestinal and reproductive tract. The molecular mechanisms
	underlying colonisation of poultry by S. Enteritidis are ill-defined.
	Targeted and genome-wide mutagenesis of S. Typhimurium has revealed
	conserved and host-specific roles for selected fimbriae in intestinal
	colonisation of different hosts. Here we report the first systematic
	analysis of each chromosomally-encoded major fimbrial subunit of
	S. Enteritidis in intestinal colonisation of chickens. RESULTS: The
	repertoire, organisation and sequence of the fimbrial operons within
	members of S. enterica were compared. No single fimbrial locus could
	be correlated with the differential virulence and host range of serovars
	by comparison of available genome sequences. Fimbrial operons were
	highly conserved among serovars in respect of gene number, order
	and sequence, with the exception of safA. Thirteen predicted major
	fimbrial subunit genes were separately inactivated by lambda Red
	recombinase-mediated linear recombination followed by P22/int transduction.
	The magnitude and duration of intestinal colonisation by mutant and
	parent strains was measured after oral inoculation of out-bred chickens.
	Whilst the majority of S. Enteritidis major fimbrial subunit genes
	played no significant role in colonisation of the avian intestines,
	mutations affecting pegA in two different S. Enteritidis strains
	produced statistically significant attenuation. Plasmid-mediated
	trans-complementation partially restored the colonisation phenotype.
	CONCLUSION: We describe the fimbrial gene repertoire of the predominant
	non-typhoidal S. enterica serovar affecting humans and the role played
	by each predicted major fimbrial subunit in intestinal colonisation
	of the primary reservoir. Our data support a role for PegA in the
	colonisation of poultry by S. Enteritidis and aid the design of improved
	vaccines.},

	Abstract = {Numerous small RNAs regulators of gene expression exist in bacteria.
	A large class of them binds to the RNA chaperone Hfq and act by base
	pairing interactions with their target mRNA, thereby affecting their
	translation and/or stability. They often have multiple direct targets,
	some of which may be regulators themselves, and production of a single
	sRNA can therefore affect the expression of dozens of genes. We show
	in this study that the synthesis of the Escherichia coli pleiotropic
	PhoPQ two-component system is repressed by MicA, a sigma(E)-dependent
	sRNA regulator of porin biogenesis. MicA directly pairs with phoPQ
	mRNA in the translation initiation region of phoP and presumably
	inhibits translation by competing with ribosome binding. Consequently,
	MicA downregulates several members of the PhoPQ regulon. By linking
	PhoPQ to sigma(E), our findings suggest that major cellular processes

	blood culture of typhoid fever cases were sought by computer search
	of the multilingual scientific literature. Where there were no eligible
	studies, data were extrapolated from neighbouring countries and regions.
	Age-incidence curves were used to model rates measured among narrow
	age cohorts to the general population. One-way sensitivity analysis
	was performed to explore the sensitivity of the estimate to the assumptions.
	The burden of paratyphoid fever was derived by a proportional method.
	FINDINGS: A total of 22 eligible studies were identified. Regions
	with high incidence of typhoid fever (>100/100,000 cases/year) include
	south-central Asia and south-eastAsia. Regions of medium incidence
	(10-100/100,000 cases/year) include the rest of Asia, Africa, Latin

	We estimate that typhoid fever caused 21,650,974 illnesses and 216,510

	Deletion of rseA leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity.

	Studies suggest that PrPC functions in several processes including
	signal transduction and Cu2+ metabolism. PrPC has also been established
	to bind nucleic acids. Therefore we investigated the properties of
	PrPC as a putative nucleic acid chaperone. Surprisingly, PrPC possesses
	all the nucleic acid chaperoning properties previously specific to
	retroviral nucleocapsid proteins. PrPC appears to be a molecular
	mimic of NCP7, the nucleocapsid protein of HIV-1. Thus PrPC, like
	NCP7, chaperones the annealing of tRNA(Lys) to the HIV-1 primer binding
	site, the initial step of retrovirus replication. PrPC also chaperones
	the two DNA strand transfers required for production of a complete
	proviral DNA with LTRs. Concerning the functions of NCP7 during budding,
	PrPC also mimices NCP7 by dimerizing the HIV-1 genomic RNA. These
	data are unprecedented because, although many cellular proteins have
	been identified as nucleic acid chaperones, none have the properties
	of retroviral nucleocapsid proteins.},

	Abstract = {Capsule formulations of two drugs under development showed slower
	dissolution upon storage; Drug A, after 2.5 weeks at 40 degrees C/23%
	RH and 4 weeks at 30 degrees C/60% RH, and Drug B, after 6 weeks
	at 50 degrees C and 40 degrees C/75% RH. The formulations of both
	drugs contained povidone as a binder and stearic acid as a lubricant.
	Replacement of stearic acid by magnesium stearate from the formulation
	of Drug B, which was selected for further studies, provided rapid
	dissolution profiles under similar storage conditions with no change
	occurring on storage. In order to investigate the role of stearic
	acid further, binary mixtures of stearic acid with the drugs and
	other excipients used in their respective formulations were prepared
	and stored at 40 degrees C/75% RH and 50 degrees C. After 1 week
	of storage, it was observed that povidone and stearic acid mixture
	formed a transparent, hard, glass-like insoluble substance. It is
	hypothesized that the substance formed by the interaction can reduce
	the porosity of the granules and thereby reduces the ingress of the
	dissolution medium leading to slower dissolution. The infrared (IR)
	spectra of the glass-like substance showed a slight broadening of
	the povidone carbonyl band at 1662 cm(-1). The powder X-ray diffraction
	of the stored mixture showed that the crystallinity of stearic acid
	was lost. Furthermore, repeated heating and cooling cycles of povidone
	and stearic acid mixtures in various proportions using differential
	scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that recrystallization of stearic
	acid from its melt was strongly affected by the presence of increasing
	amounts of povidone. Based on the observed solid-state interaction,
	a combination of stearic and povidone should be avoided for immediate
	release formulations.},

	2457T encodes the Sfh protein, a paralogue of the global transcriptional
	repressor H-NS. Sfh allows pSfR27 to be transmitted to new bacterial
	hosts with minimal impact on host fitness, providing a 'stealth'
	function whose molecular mechanism has yet to be determined. The
	impact of the Sfh protein on the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
	transcriptome was assessed and binding sites for Sfh in the Salmonella
	Typhimurium genome were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation.
	Sfh did not bind uniquely to any sites. Instead, it bound to a subset
	of the larger H-NS regulatory network. Analysis of Sfh binding in
	the absence of H-NS revealed a greatly expanded population of Sfh
	binding sites that included the majority of H-NS target genes. Furthermore,
	the presence of plasmid pSfR27 caused a decrease in H-NS interactions
	with the S. Typhimurium chromosome, suggesting that the A + T-rich
	DNA of this large plasmid acts to titrate H-NS, removing it from
	chromosomal locations. It is proposed that Sfh acts as a molecular

	H-NS on the chromosome, thus minimizing disturbances to the H-NS-DNA
	binding pattern in cells that acquire pSfR27.},

	Abstract = {RNase E is a key regulatory enzyme that controls the principal pathway
	for mRNA degradation in Escherichia coli. The cellular concentration
	of this endonuclease is governed by a feedback mechanism in which
	RNase E tightly regulates its own synthesis. Autoregulation is mediated
	in cis by the 361-nucleotide 5' untranslated region (UTR) of rne
	(RNase E) mRNA. Here we report the determination of the secondary
	structure of the rne 5' UTR by phylogenetic comparison and chemical
	alkylation, together with dissection studies to identify the 5' UTR
	element that mediates autoregulation. Our findings reveal that the
	structure and function of the rne 5' UTRs are evolutionarily well
	conserved despite extensive sequence divergence. Within the rne 5'
	UTRs are multiple RNA secondary structure elements, two of which
	function in cis to mediate feedback regulation of rne gene expression.
	The more potent of these two elements is a stem-loop structure containing
	an internal loop whose sequence is the most highly conserved of any
	region of the rne 5' UTR. Our data show that this stem-loop functions

	The predominant EHEC serotype affecting humans in the UK and North

	contact with ruminant faeces. Strategies to reduce the carriage of
	EHEC in ruminants are expected to lower the incidence of human EHEC
	infections; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying persistence
	of EHEC in ruminants are poorly understood. This paper reports the
	first comprehensive survey for EHEC factors mediating colonization
	of the bovine intestines by using signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis.
	Seventy-nine E. coli O157 : H7 mutants impaired in their ability
	to colonize calves were isolated and 59 different genes required
	for intestinal colonization were identified by cloning and sequencing
	of the transposon insertion sites. Thirteen transposon insertions

	encodes a type III protein secretion system required for the formation
	of attaching and effacing lesions on intestinal epithelia. A putative
	structural component of the apparatus (EscN) is essential for intestinal
	colonization; however, the type III secreted effector protein Map
	plays only a minor role. Other Type III secretion-associated genes

	classes of lambda mutants defective in the establishment of repression
	are also defective in the appearance of cI protein activity at the
	normal time. Two of these mutational classes (cII(-) and cIII(-))
	probably result from inactivation of lambda-specified proteins, but
	the third class (cy(-)) may involve a structural defect. We conclude
	that at least three regulatory elements are likely to be required
	for the normal turn-on of cI protein synthesis in an infected nonlysogenic
	cell: cII and cIII proteins and an "active" y-region of lambda DNA.
	From these and other results, the complete role of cII and cIII proteins
	in the establishment of repression may involve a bifunctional regulatory
	activity: positive regulation of the cI gene and negative regulation
	of late genes. A possible molecular model for cII and cIII action
	is discussed. Since the cII and cIII genes are repressed by the cI
	protein under conditions of stable lysogeny, a separate mechanism
	is required for the maintenance of cI protein synthesis. After infection
	of a lysogen by cII(-) phage, the rate of increase of cI protein
	activity is substantially greater than after infection of a nonlysogen.
	From these and other results, the cI protein may also have a bifunctional
	regulatory activity: positive regulation of the cI gene and negative
	regulation of early lytic genes.},

	probabilistic inference using profile hidden Markov models. Our aim
	in HMMER3 is to achieve BLAST's speed while further improving the
	power of probabilistic inference based methods. HMMER3 implements
	a new probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new heuristic
	acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient vector-parallel implementations
	on modern processors, these improvements synergize. HMMER3 uses more
	powerful log-odds likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment
	uncertainty, rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it
	calculates accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores
	without simulation using a generalization of Karlin/Altschul theory;
	it computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible
	alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in each

	or more who commenced home PD between January 31, 1994, and December
	31, 2001 were included. Clinical data were available for 358 patients
	out of 418 total patients who started PD during this period. They
	were followed until cessation of PD, death, or to January 31, 2003.
	Survival probabilities were generated according to the Kaplan-Meier
	method, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used
	to assess predictors of survival. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients
	were enrolled in the study. Among them, 139 patients (38.8%) were
	diabetics. The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year patient survival rates were
	91%, 76%, 66% and 47% in diabetics and 94%, 89%, 84% and 69% in non-diabetics,
	respectively. Median actuarial patient survival for diabetic patients
	(51.8 months; 95% CI 36.0 a 67.5 months) was significantly shorter
	than that of non-diabetic patients (log rank 14.117, p < 0.001).
	Death-censored technique survival rates at 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year
	were 90%, 83%, 67% and 58% in diabetic, and 94%, 87%, 77% and 70%
	in non-diabetic patients, respectively. Similar to patient survival,
	the median technique survival time was significantly shorter for
	diabetic patients (63.9 months; 95% CI 35.7 - 92.2 months) than that
	of non-diabetic patients (log rank 4.884, p = 0.027). Multivariate
	Cox regression analysis showed that advancing age was the only independent
	predictor of death in the diabetic patients, whereas higher age and
	wider pulse pressure were associated with mortality in non-diabetic
	patients. CONCLUSION: Long-term patient and technique survival for
	diabetic patients on PD seem to be improved compared to our previous
	report and other studies. The mortality of diabetic patients was
	predicted predominantly by advancing age. PD remains a viable form
	of long-term renal replacement therapy for diabetic patients with

	Mutant Db11 was used for the isolation of two phages, phi J and phi

	by the same operon. Early after infection the whole operon is transcribed
	from the constitutive promoter PLE. In the lysogenic condition transcription
	from PLE terminates prematurely and only the immunity functions,
	which are proximal to the promoter, are thus expressed. Fragments
	of the P4 immunity region were cloned in an expression vector. A
	DNA fragment as short as 91 bp was sufficient, when transcribed,
	to express P4 immunity and to complement P4 immunity deficient mutants.
	This fragment, like prophage P4, produced a 69 nt long RNA (CI RNA).
	A shorter P4 fragment neither expressed immunity nor synthesized
	the CI RNA. Thus the CI RNA is the P4 trans-acting immunity factor.
	The 5' end of the CI RNA, mapped by primer extension, does not correspond
	to the transcription initiation point, thus suggesting that the CI
	RNA is produced by processing of the primary transcript. In an RNase
	P mutant host the processing of the 5' end and the production of
	a functional CI RNA were impaired. The requirement of RNase P for
	the correct processing of CI appears to be related to the predicted
	secondary structure of the precursor CI RNA. A region (seqB) within
	the CI RNA shows complementarity with two cis-acting sequences (seqA

	termination may be caused by pairing of the CI RNA with the complementary

	poorly understood complication of supratentorial neurosurgical procedures.
	We retrospectively compared 42 patients who experienced RCH with
	a case-matched control cohort, to delineate risk factors associated
	with the occurrence of this complication. METHODS: Between 1988 and
	2000, 42 patients experienced RCH after supratentorial neurosurgical
	procedures at our institution. Diagnoses were made on the basis of
	postoperative computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging
	findings in all cases. The medical records for these patients were
	reviewed and compared with those for a control cohort of 43 patients,
	matched for age, sex, surgical lesion, and type of craniotomy, who
	were treated during the same period. RESULTS: RCH most commonly occurred
	after frontotemporal craniotomies for unruptured aneurysm repair
	or temporal lobectomy and was frequently an incidental finding on
	postoperative computed tomographic scans. However, some cases of
	RCH were associated with significant morbidity, and two patients
	died. Preoperative aspirin use and elevated intraoperative systolic
	blood pressure were significantly associated with RCH (P = 0.026
	and P = 0.036, respectively). Pathological findings for two cases
	demonstrated hemorrhagic infarctions in both. CONCLUSION: RCH most
	commonly follows supratentorial neurosurgical procedures, performed
	with the patient in the supine position, that involve opening of
	cerebrospinal fluid cisterns or the ventricular system (such as unruptured
	aneurysm repair or temporal lobectomy). Preoperative aspirin use
	and moderately elevated intraoperative systolic blood pressure are
	potentially modifiable risk factors associated with the development
	of RCH. Although RCH can cause death or major morbidity, most cases
	are asymptomatic or exhibit a benign course. Cerebellar "sag" as

	Abstract = {Refrigeration to limit bacterial multiplication is a critical aspect
	of efforts to control the transmission of Salmonella enterica serovar
	Enteritidis (SE) to consumers of contaminated eggs. Although the
	nutrient-rich yolk interior is an uncommon location for SE contamination
	in freshly laid, naturally contaminated eggs, migration across the
	vitelline membrane could lead to rapid bacterial multiplication even
	when the initial site of deposition is outside the yolk. Multiplication
	on the yolk membrane (before, or in addition to, multiplication within
	the yolk contents) could be another source of increased risk to consumers.
	The present study used an in vitro egg contamination model to compare
	the abilities of four strains of SE to either multiply in association
	with the yolk membrane or migrate through that membrane to reach
	the yolk contents during 36 h of incubation at 30 degrees C. After
	inoculation onto the exterior surface of intact, whole yolks, all
	four SE strains penetrated the vitelline membrane to reach the yolk
	contents (at an overall frequency of 11.5%) after 12 h of incubation.
	The mean log concentration of SE was significantly higher in whole
	yolks (including yolk membranes) than in yolk contents at both 12
	h (0.818 versus 0.167 CFU/ ml) and 36 h (2.767 versus 1.402 CFU/ml)
	of incubation. These results demonstrate that SE multiplication on
	the vitelline membrane may both precede and exceed multiplication
	resulting from penetration into the yolk contents during the first
	36 h of unrefrigerated storage, reinforcing the importance of rapid
	refrigeration for protecting consumers from egg-transmitted illness.},

	transmitted horizontally, i.e., in an exogenous way. Occasionally,
	however, some retroviruses can also infect and integrate into the
	genome of germ cells, which may allow for their vertical inheritance
	and fixation in a given species; a process known as endogenization.
	Lentiviruses, a group of mammalian retroviruses that includes HIV,
	are known to infect primates, ruminants, horses, and cats. Unlike
	many other retroviruses, these viruses have not been demonstrably
	successful at germline infiltration. Here, we report on the discovery
	of endogenous lentiviral insertions in seven species of Malagasy
	lemurs from two different genera -- Cheirogaleus and Microcebus.
	Combining molecular clock analyses and cross-species screening of
	orthologous insertions, we show that the presence of this endogenous
	lentivirus in six species of Microcebus is the result of one endogenization
	event that occurred about 4.2 million years ago. In addition, we
	demonstrate that this lentivirus independently infiltrated the germline
	of Cheirogaleus and that the two endogenization events occurred quasi-simultaneously.
	Using multiple proviral copies, we derive and characterize an apparently
	full length and intact consensus for this lentivirus. These results
	provide evidence that lentiviruses have repeatedly infiltrated the
	germline of prosimian species and that primates have been exposed

	bacteria. The sigma(E) stress response was characterized as a single-tier
	activation network comprised of ~100 genes, including the MicA and
	RybB noncoding sRNAs. These highly expressed sRNAs were thought to
	carry out the specialized function of halting de novo synthesis of
	several abundant porins when envelope homeostasis was perturbed.
	Using a systematic target profiling and validation approach we discovered
	that MicA and RybB are each global mRNA repressors of both distinct
	and shared targets, and that the two sRNAs constitute a posttranscriptional
	repression arm whose regulatory scope rivals that of the protein-based

	~1/3 of all targets and new nonporin targets predict roles for MicA
	and RybB in crosstalk with other regulatory responses. This work
	also provides an example of evolutionarily unrelated sRNAs that are
	coinduced and bind the same targets, but at different sites. Our
	finding that expression of either MicA or RybB sRNA protects the

	The GlmY and GlmZ sRNAs of Y. pseudotuberculosis are transcribed

	regulator GlrR through binding to three conserved sites located upstream
	of the promoters. This also applies to glmY/glmZ of S. typhimurium

	overlap the sigma(54)-promoters and initiate transcription at the

	of global phenotypic profiling to directly define the genes required
	for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A combination of high-density
	mutagenesis and deep-sequencing was used to characterize the composition
	of complex mutant libraries exposed to different conditions. This

	Few of the genes we identified had previously been implicated in

	LT2-Z, SR-11, and SL1344, which possessed 100-kb plasmids with identical
	restriction enzyme digestion profiles, were cured of their respective
	100-kb plasmids after Tnmini-tet was used to label plasmids. Curing
	wild-type virulent strains SR-11 and SL1344 raised peroral 50% lethal
	doses from 3 x 10(5) and 6 x 10(4) CFU, respectively, to greater
	than 10(8) CFU. Both wild-type strains had intraperitoneal 50% lethal
	doses of less than 50 CFU, whereas the intraperitoneal 50% lethal
	doses for cured SR-11 and SL1344 were less than 50 and 400 CFU, respectively.
	Reintroduction of the Tnmini-tet-labeled, 100-kb plasmid restored
	wild-type virulence. Invasion from Peyer's patches to mesenteric
	lymph nodes and spleens after peroral inoculation was the stage of
	pathogenesis most affected by curing S. typhimurium of the 100-kb
	plasmid. Wild-type S. typhimurium replicated in spleens of mice inoculated
	intravenously to a greater extent than did plasmid-cured derivatives.
	Wild-type and cured strains equally adhered to and invaded Henle-407,
	HEp-2, and CHO cells; furthermore, the presence of the 100-kb plasmid
	was not necessary for replication of S. typhimurium within CHO cells.
	The 100-kb plasmid had no effect on phagocytosis and killing of S.
	typhimurium by murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro and in vivo.
	Similarly, wild-type and plasmid-cured strains were resistant to
	killing by 90% normal human, rabbit, and guinea pig sera. All wild-type

	Abstract = {The virulence plasmids of Salmonella typhimurium and other invasive
	Salmonella serovars have long been associated with the ability of
	these bacteria to cause systemic infection beyond the intestines
	in orally inoculated animals. Genetic analysis of virulence genes
	on the high-molecular-weight plasmids has revealed that no more than
	five genes spanning a 6.2-kb region are sufficient to replace the
	entire plasmid for conferring virulence. However, the exact virulence
	function(s) encoded by these genes has not been elucidated. In this
	report, we measured the possible effect of the virulence plasmid
	on the growth rate of S. typhimurium in mice by two complementary
	procedures. The first procedure used segregation of a temperature-sensitive
	plasmid in vivo to provide a measure of bacterial divisions and the
	number of recovered marker plasmid-containing salmonellae as a measure
	of killing. In the second procedure, aroA deletions were transduced
	into virulence plasmid-containing and plasmid-cured S. typhimurium.
	Since AroA- salmonellae are inhibited for growth in vivo, if the
	virulence plasmid affected only growth rate, no difference in the
	recoveries of the paired AroA- strains would be seen. Virulence plasmid-containing
	S. typhimurium segregated the marker plasmid more rapidly than did
	the virulence plasmid-cured strain, and AroA- derivatives of both
	strains were recovered equally from mice. Therefore, the S. typhimurium
	virulence plasmid increased growth rate but had no detectable effect
	on killing or bacterial movement into deep tissues. To examine whether
	the plasmid accomplished this function by affecting the intracellular/extracellular
	location of bacteria, orally infected mice were injected with gentamicin
	to kill the extracellular bacteria. Wild-type and plasmid-cured S.
	typhimurium strains were equally resistant to gentamicin in vivo
	and hence most likely located intracellularly to equal degrees. When
	wild-type and plasmid-cured S. typhimurium strains were sequestered
	within peritoneal chambers in mice, the resulting extracellular growth
	was equal. Therefore, the virulence plasmid increases the growth
	rate of S. typhimurium in mice, probably within mouse cells.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns regarding the safety of transfused blood have
	prompted re-consideration of the use of allogeneic (blood from an
	unrelated donor) blood transfusion. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects
	of the anti-fibrinolytic drugs aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and epsilon
	aminocaproic acid, on peri-operative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.
	SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE (to May 1998), EMBASE (to December
	1997), web sites of international health technology assessment agencies
	(to May 1998). References in identified trials and review articles
	were checked and authors contacted to identify any additional studies.
	SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of anti-fibrinolytic
	drugs in adults scheduled for non-urgent surgery. DATA COLLECTION
	AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality
	and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We found 61 trials of aprotinin
	(7027 participants). Aprotinin reduced the rate of RBC transfusion
	by a relative 30% (RR=0.70: 95%CI: 0.64 to 0.76). The average absolute
	risk reduction (ARR) was 20.4% (95%CI: 15.6% to 25.3%). On average,
	aprotinin use saved 1.1 units of RBC (95%CI: 0.69 to 1.47) in those
	requiring transfusion. Aprotinin also significantly reduced the need
	for re-operation due to bleeding (RR=0.40: 95%CI: 0.25 to 0.66).
	We found 18 trials of tranexamic acid (TXA) (1,342 participants).
	TXA reduced the rate of RBC transfusion by a relative 34% (RR=0.66:
	95%CI: 0.54 to 0.81). This represented an ARR of 17.2% (95%CI: 8.7%
	to 25.7%). TXA use resulted in a saving of 1.03 units of RBC (95%CI:
	0.67 to 1.39) in those requiring transfusion. We found four trials
	of epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) (208 participants). EACA use
	resulted in a statistically non-significant reduction in RBC transfusion
	(RR=0.48: 95%CI: 0.19 to 1.19). Comparisons between agents Eight
	trials made 'head-to-head' comparisons between TXA and aprotinin.
	There was no significant difference between the two drugs in the
	rate of RBC transfusion: RR=1.21 (95%CI: 0.83 to 1.76) for TXA compared
	to aprotinin. Adverse Effects Aprotinin did not seem to be associated
	with an excess risk of adverse effects, including thrombo-embolic
	events (thrombosis RR=0.64: 95%CI: 0.31 to 1.31) and renal failure
	(RR=1.19: 95%CI: 0.79 to 1.79). Fewer data were available for TXA
	and EACA. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: From this review it appears that
	aprotinin reduces the need for red cell transfusion, and the need
	for re-operation due to bleeding, without serious adverse effects.
	However, there was significant heterogeneity in trial outcomes, and
	some evidence of publication bias. Similar trends were seen with
	TXA and EACA, although the data were rather sparse. The poor evaluation
	of these latter drugs is unfortunate as results suggest they may
	be equally as effective as aprotinin, but are significantly cheaper.
	The evidence reviewed here supports the use of aprotinin in cardiac
	surgery. Further small trials of this drug are not warranted. Future
	trials should be large enough to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness
	of aprotinin with that of TXA and EACA.},

	unrelated donor) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and a range of
	techniques designed to minimise transfusion requirements. OBJECTIVES:
	To examine the evidence for the efficacy of desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin),
	in reducing perioperative blood loss and the need for red cell transfusion
	in patients who do not have congenital bleeding disorders. SEARCH
	STRATEGY: Articles were identified by: computer searches of OVID
	MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents (to August 2000) and web sites
	of international health technology assessment agencies (to May 1998).
	References in the identified trials and review articles were checked
	and authors contacted to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA:
	Randomised controlled parallel group trials in which adult patients,
	scheduled for non-urgent surgery, were randomised to DDAVP, or to
	a control group, who did not receive the intervention. DATA COLLECTION
	AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed using criteria proposed
	by Schulz et al. (1995) and Jadad et al. (1996). The principal outcomes
	were: the number of patients exposed to red cells, and the amount
	of blood transfused. Other clinical outcomes are detailed in the
	review. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials of DDAVP (N=1034) reported
	data on the proportion of patients exposed to allogeneic RBC transfusion.
	In subjects treated with DDAVP the relative risk of exposure to peri-operative
	allogeneic blood transfusion was 0.98 (95%CI: 0.88 to 1.10) compared
	with control. In DDAVP-treated patients the relative risk of requiring
	re-operation due to bleeding was 0.56 (95%CI: 0.18 to 1.73). There
	was no statistically significant effect overall for mortality and
	non-fatal myocardial infarction in DDAVP-treated patients compared
	with control (RR=1.53: 95%CI: 0.58 to 4.05) and (RR=1.52: 95%CI:
	0.67 to 3.49) respectively. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no convincing
	evidence that desmopressin minimises perioperative allogeneic RBC
	transfusion in patients who do not have congenital bleeding disorders.
	These data suggest that there is no benefit of using DDAVP as a means
	of minimising perioperative allogeneic RBC transfusion. This meta-analysis
	had 90% power to detect a relative risk reduction of at least 17%
	for receiving a red cell transfusion at alpha = 0.05 (two-sided).},

	and porin (SRP) proteins derived from Salmonella enterica serotype
	Newport on milk production, somatic cell count, and shedding of Salmonella
	organisms in female dairy cattle. ANIMALS: 180 female Holsteins.
	PROCEDURES: Cattle were randomly assigned to receive Salmonella Newport
	SRP vaccine or control solution. Vaccine or control solution was
	injected 45 to 60 days before parturition, and cattle received a
	second dose 14 to 21 days before parturition. Milk production was
	monitored for the first 90 days of lactation. Feces for isolation
	of Salmonella and blood samples for detection of antibodies against
	Salmonella Newport were collected at day of first injection and at
	days 7 to 14 and 28 to 35 of lactation. RESULTS: Cattle inoculated
	with Salmonella Newport vaccine produced significantly more milk
	(1.14 kg/d), compared with cattle injected with the control solution.
	Cattle administered the vaccine had significantly higher concentrations
	of circulating antibody against Salmonella Newport SRP proteins at
	7 to 14 days and 28 to 35 days of lactation. Salmonella Newport was
	not recovered; however, Salmonella enterica serotype Agona was recovered
	from 31 (20.3%) cattle, but likelihood of recovery did not differ
	significantly between vaccinates and control cattle. CONCLUSIONS
	AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Administration of a vaccine against Salmonella
	Newport SRP proteins to healthy dairy cattle prior to parturition
	increased milk production, even in cattle without detectable shedding
	of Salmonella Newport or clinical signs of salmonellosis. Additional

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Of the > 2000 serovars of Salmonella enterica subspecies
	I, most cause self-limiting gastrointestinal disease in a wide range
	of mammalian hosts. However, S. enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi
	A are restricted to the human host and cause the similar systemic
	diseases typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Genome sequence similarity
	between Paratyphi A and Typhi has been attributed to convergent evolution
	via relatively recent recombination of a quarter of their genomes.
	The accumulation of pseudogenes is a key feature of these and other
	host-adapted pathogens, and overlapping pseudogene complements are
	evident in Paratyphi A and Typhi. RESULTS: We report the 4.5 Mbp
	genome of a clinical isolate of Paratyphi A, strain AKU_12601, completely
	sequenced using capillary techniques and subsequently checked using
	Illumina/Solexa resequencing. Comparison with the published genome
	of Paratyphi A ATCC9150 revealed the two are collinear and highly
	similar, with 188 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 39 insertions/deletions.
	A comparative analysis of pseudogene complements of these and two
	finished Typhi genomes (CT18, Ty2) identified several pseudogenes
	that had been overlooked in prior genome annotations of one or both
	serovars, and identified 66 pseudogenes shared between serovars.
	By determining whether each shared and serovar-specific pseudogene
	had been recombined between Paratyphi A and Typhi, we found evidence
	that most pseudogenes have accumulated after the recombination between
	serovars. We also divided pseudogenes into relative-time groups:
	ancestral pseudogenes inherited from a common ancestor, pseudogenes
	recombined between serovars which likely arose between initial divergence
	and later recombination, serovar-specific pseudogenes arising after
	recombination but prior to the last evolutionary bottlenecks in each
	population, and more recent strain-specific pseudogenes. CONCLUSION:
	Recombination and pseudogene-formation have been important mechanisms
	of genetic convergence between Paratyphi A and Typhi, with most pseudogenes
	arising independently after extensive recombination between the serovars.
	The recombination events, along with divergence of and within each
	serovar, provide a relative time scale for pseudogene-forming mutations,
	affording rare insights into the progression of functional gene loss
	associated with host adaptation in Salmonella.},

	Abstract = {Analyses of cellular processes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
	rely primarily upon a small number of highly domesticated laboratory
	strains, leaving the extensive natural genetic diversity of the model
	organism largely unexplored and unexploited. We asked if this diversity
	could be used to enrich our understanding of basic biological processes.
	As a test case, we examined a simple trait: the utilization of di/tripeptides
	as nitrogen sources. The capacity to import small peptides is likely
	to be under opposing selective pressures (nutrient utilization versus
	toxin vulnerability) and may therefore be sculpted by diverse pathways
	and strategies. Hitherto, dipeptide utilization in S. cerevisiae
	was solely ascribed to the activity of a single protein, the Ptr2p
	transporter. Using high-throughput phenotyping and several genetically
	diverse strains, we identified previously unknown cellular activities
	that contribute to this trait. We find that the Dal5p allantoate/ureidosuccinate
	permease is also capable of facilitating di/tripeptide transport.
	Moreover, even in the absence of Dal5p and Ptr2p, an additional activity--almost
	certainly the periplasmic asparaginase II Asp3p--facilitates the
	utilization of dipeptides with C-terminal asparagine residues by
	a different strategy. Another, as-yet-unidentified activity enables
	the utilization of dipeptides with C-terminal arginine residues.
	The relative contributions of these activities to the utilization
	of di/tripeptides vary among the strains analyzed, as does the vulnerability
	of these strains to a toxic dipeptide. Only by sampling the genetic
	diversity of multiple strains were we able to uncover several previously
	unrecognized layers of complexity in this metabolic pathway. High-throughput
	phenotyping facilitates the rapid exploration of the molecular basis
	of biological complexity, allowing for future detailed investigation

	the continued development and improvement of treatments to ensure
	the most effective management. Compression therapy or surgical correction
	of superficial venous incompetence (SVI) are currently the main methods
	employed for the treatment for venous ulceration (VU). This review
	compares and summates the healing and recurrence rates for each treatment
	modality used over the last thirty years. METHODS: Sixty-one articles
	investigating compression and superficial venous surgical treatments
	were obtained from a systematic search of electronic databases (Medline,
	Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) and then an expanded
	reference list review. Patient demographics, CEAP classification,
	patterns of venous insufficiency, type of intervention, length of
	follow up, healing and recurrence rates for venous ulceration was
	assessed. Inadequate data in seven reports led to their exclusion.
	Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) specifically comparing
	superficial surgery to compression therapy were reviewed and data
	from non-randomised and/or 'small' clinical studies prior to 2000
	underwent summation analysis. RESULTS: Five RCTs since 2000 demonstrate
	a similar healing rate of VU with surgery and conservative compression
	treatments, but a reduction in ulcer recurrence rate with surgery.
	The effect of deep venous incompetence (DVI) on the ulcer healing
	is unclear, but sub-group analysis of long-term data from the ESCHAR
	trial suggests that although surgery results in a less impressive
	reduction in ulcer recurrence in patients with DVI, these patients
	appear to still benefit from surgery due to the haemodynamic and
	clinical benefits that result. The RCTs also highlight that a significant
	proportion of VU patients are unsuitable for surgical treatment.
	Summation of data from earlier studies (before 2000), included twenty-one
	studies employing conservative compression alone resulted in an overall
	healing rate of 65% (range 34-95%) and ulcer recurrence of 33% (range
	0-100%). In thirty-one studies investigating superficial venous surgery,
	the overall rate of ulcer healing was 81% (range 40-100%) with a
	post-operative recurrence rate of 15% (range 0-55%). The duration
	of follow up care in the surgical studies was approximately twice
	as long as in the conservative studies, which would lend to more
	reliable recurrence data. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from the current
	literature, would suggest that superficial venous surgery is associated
	with similar rates of ulcer healing to compression alone, but with
	less recurrence. The effects of post-operative compression and DVI
	on the efficacy of surgery are still unclear.},

	in both the destruction of the colonic epithelium and in controlling
	and containing the Shigella infection. The host's humoral response
	to S. flexneri also appears to be important in protecting the host,

	filtering steps, HMMERHEAD, that are applied prior to the scoring
	algorithms, as implemented in the HMMER package, in an effort to
	reduce search time. Using this heuristic, we obtain a 20-fold decrease

	loss in sensitivity relative to the unfiltered approaches. We then
	implemented an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER, which

	eliminated the subdatabase creation that is common in current iterative
	profile-HMM approaches. On our benchmark, JackHMMER detects 14% more

	In Neurospora crassa, three allelic specificities at the het-c locus
	are conferred by a highly polymorphic domain. This domain shows trans-species
	polymorphisms indicative of balancing selection, consistent with
	the role of het loci in nonself recognition. We determined that a

	with het-c) was required for het-c nonself recognition and heterokaryon
	incompatibility (HI). The pin-c alleles in isolates that differ in

	tests showed that nonself recognition was mediated by synergistic
	nonallelic interactions between het-c and pin-c, while allelic interactions
	at het-c increased the severity of the HI phenotype. The pin-c locus
	encodes a protein containing a HET domain; predicted proteins containing

	of the Escherichia coli genome. The system is based on in vitro transposition
	of a modified Tn5 element, the Sce-poson, into linear fragments of
	each open reading frame. The transposon introduces both positive
	(kanamycin resistance) and negative (I-SceI recognition site) selectable
	markers for isolation of mutants and subsequent allele replacement,
	respectively. Reaction products are then introduced into the genome
	by homologous recombination via the lambdaRed proteins. The method
	has yielded insertion alleles for 1976 genes during a first pass
	through the genome including, unexpectedly, a number of known and
	putative essential genes. Sce-poson insertions can be easily replaced
	by markerless mutations by using the I-SceI homing endonuclease to
	select against retention of the transposon as demonstrated by the

	Abstract = {An unusual pattern in a nucleic acid or protein sequence or a region
	of strong similarity shared by two or more sequences may have biological
	significance. It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern
	can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence
	patterns, appropriate scoring values can be assigned to the individual
	residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several
	sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect
	biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or
	secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect
	nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of
	ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that
	provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical
	significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class
	of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In
	certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which
	are "optimal" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns.
	Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of
	protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological
	features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription
	factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments
	in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically significant
	subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis
	gene.},

	Abstract = {We studied a Japanese family with type I antithrombin (AT) deficiency
	and identified a novel in-frame deletion mutation (-ATG at nucleotide
	position of 2771-2773) in the AT gene, which predicted loss of a
	methionine (Met) at amino acid number of 103. In addition, we found
	a single base replacement of G to A at nucleotide position of 67
	(4 base upstream to the initial codon) in the mutant allele. Since
	the G67A substitution in the AT gene was very rare, this family was
	the second case, in which the nucleotide change was transmitted.
	To elucidate the mechanism of AT deficiency, we transiently expressed
	wild type and the mutant AT (DeltaM103) in HuH-7 human hepatoma cells
	and performed pulse-chase studies. The experiments revealed that
	the mutant AT (DeltaM103) hardly secreted into the medium and underwent
	partial intracellular degradation. In addition, we performed luciferase
	reporter assay to examine the effect of G67A substitution on the
	AT gene expression, and found that the substitution did not reduce
	the luciferase activity. These results suggested that secretion defect
	and intracellular degradation of the variant molecule with the deletion

	Minor alleles of a common regulatory haplotype and noncoding GWAS

	In the present study, we used footprinting with Fe-BABE (a protein-labeling

	that the two ExsA monomers bind to the P(exsC), P(exsD), P(exoT),
	and P(pcrG) promoters in a head-to-tail orientation. The footprinting
	data further indicate that the conserved GnC and TGnnA sequences

	bacterium associated with periodontal disease onset and progression.
	Genetic tools for the manipulation of bacterial genomes allow for
	in-depth mechanistic studies of metabolism, physiology, interspecies
	and host-pathogen interactions. Analysis of the essential genes,
	protein-coding sequences necessary for survival of P. gingivalis
	by transposon mutagenesis has not previously been attempted due to
	the limitations of available transposon systems for the organism.
	We adapted a Mariner transposon system for mutagenesis of P. gingivalis
	and created an insertion mutant library. By analyzing the location
	of insertions using massively-parallel sequencing technology we used
	this mutant library to define genes essential for P. gingivalis survival
	under in vitro conditions. RESULTS: In mutagenesis experiments we
	identified 463 genes in P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277 that are
	putatively essential for viability in vitro. Comparing the 463 P.
	gingivalis essential genes with previous essential gene studies,
	364 of the 463 are homologues to essential genes in other species;
	339 are shared with more than one other species. Twenty-five genes
	are known to be essential in P. gingivalis and B. thetaiotaomicron
	only. Significant enrichment of essential genes within Cluster of
	Orthologous Groups 'D' (cell division), 'I' (lipid transport and
	metabolism) and 'J' (translation/ribosome) were identified. Previously,
	the P. gingivalis core genome was shown to encode 1,476 proteins
	out of a possible 1,909; 434 of 463 essential genes are contained
	within the core genome. Thus, for the species P. gingivalis twenty-two,
	seventy-seven and twenty-three percent of the genome respectively
	are devoted to essential, core and accessory functions. CONCLUSIONS:
	A Mariner transposon system can be adapted to create mutant libraries
	in P. gingivalis amenable to analysis by next-generation sequencing
	technologies. In silico analysis of genes essential for in vitro
	growth demonstrates that although the majority are homologous across
	bacterial species as a whole, species and strain-specific subsets
	are apparent. Understanding the putative essential genes of P. gingivalis
	will provide insights into metabolic pathways and niche adaptations

	Abstract = {A novel screening approach based on insertion-duplication mutagenesis
	(IDM) was established to efficiently screen for essential genes of
	Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium under laboratory conditions.
	Small, randomly generated genomic fragments were cloned into a conditionally
	replicating vector, and the resulting library of single Salmonella
	clones was grown under permissive conditions. Upon switching to non-permissive
	temperature, discrimination between lethal and non-lethal insertions
	following homologous recombination allowed the trapping of genes
	with essential functions. Further characterization of a total of
	498 fragments resulting in such lethal knockout revealed 145 known
	essential genes and 112 functionally characterized or hypothetical
	genes not yet shown to encode essential genes, among them three Salmonella-specific
	genes. The essentiality was demonstrated for a prioritised set of
	15 putative indispensable genes by creating conditional lethal phenotypes.
	The results of this large-scale screening indicate that in rich media,

	techniques that could lead to shorter postoperative stay and reducing
	cost of health provision are welcomed. We report the results of a
	prospective randomized trial to investigate the role of harmonic
	scalpel (HS) in reducing postsurgical seroma formation, complications,
	pain and consequent cost in breast surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
	Thirty-three procedures were carried out on 32 women. Patients were
	prospectively randomized to either HS or electrocautery (EC). The
	two cohorts were accordingly matched and postsurgical seroma volumes,
	complications and pain scores were documented. RESULTS: There were
	16 procedures in the HS and 17 in the EC group. First 48 h drainage,
	total drained volume, aspirated volume, operative time, pain score,
	number of patients that developed seromas, number of clinic visits
	for aspiration, complications and required analgesia were comparable
	in the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed no significant correlation

	This finding suggests that sRNAs play a critical role in the regulation

	Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolli
	and Xanthomonas alfalfae subsp. citrumelonis. The first of the three
	species, which causes citrus bacterial canker type A, is the most
	widely spread and severe, attacking all citrus species. In Brazil,
	this species is the most important, being found in practically all
	areas where citrus canker has been detected. Like most phytobacterioses,
	there is no efficient way to control citrus canker. Considering the
	importance of the disease worldwide, investigation is needed to accurately
	detect which genes are related to the pathogen-host adaptation process
	and which are associated with pathogenesis. RESULTS: Through transposon
	insertion mutagenesis, 10,000 mutants of Xanthomonas citri subsp.
	citri strain 306 (Xcc) were obtained, and 3,300 were inoculated in
	Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia) leaves. Their ability to cause citrus
	canker was analyzed every 3 days until 21 days after inoculation;
	a set of 44 mutants showed altered virulence, with 8 presenting a
	complete loss of causing citrus canker symptoms. Sequencing of the
	insertion site in all 44 mutants revealed that 35 different ORFs
	were hit, since some ORFs were hit in more than one mutant, with
	mutants for the same ORF presenting the same phenotype. An analysis
	of these ORFs showed that some encoded genes were previously known
	as related to pathogenicity in phytobacteria and, more interestingly,
	revealed new genes never implicated with Xanthomonas pathogenicity
	before, including hypothetical ORFs. Among the 8 mutants with no
	canker symptoms are the hrpB4 and hrpX genes, two genes that belong
	to type III secretion system (TTSS), two hypothetical ORFS and, surprisingly,
	the htrA gene, a gene reported as involved with the virulence process
	in animal-pathogenic bacteria but not described as involved in phytobacteria
	virulence. Nucleic acid hybridization using labeled cDNA probes showed
	that some of the mutated genes are differentially expressed when
	the bacterium is grown in citrus leaves. Finally, comparative genomic
	analysis revealed that 5 mutated ORFs are in new putative pathogenicity
	islands. CONCLUSION: The identification of these new genes related
	with Xcc infection and virulence is a great step towards the understanding
	of plant-pathogen interactions and could allow the development of

	during the procedure by a play specialist. Venepuncture was carried

	was used for objective pain score at the end of the procedure. After
	one exclusion, the treatment group (17 children) and the placebo

	and comprehension, previous reports had indicated two different patterns:
	(a) a parallel decline in accuracy of naming and comprehension, with
	frequent semantic naming errors, suggesting a purely semantic basis
	for the anomia and (b) a dramatic progressive anomia without commensurate
	decline in comprehension, which might suggest a mainly postsemantic
	source of the anomia. Longitudinal data for 16 patients with semantic
	dementia reflected these two profiles, but with the following additional
	important specifications: (1) despite a few relatively extreme versions
	of one or other profile, the full set of cases formed a continuum
	in the extent of anomia for a given degree of degraded comprehension;
	(2) the degree of disparity between these two abilities was associated
	with relative asymmetry in laterality of atrophy: a parallel decline
	in the two measures characterized patients with greater right- than
	left-temporal atrophy, while disproportionate anomia occurred with
	a predominance of atrophy in the left-temporal lobe. In an implemented
	computational model of naming, semantic representations were distributed
	across simulated left- and right-temporal regions, but the semantic
	units on the left were more strongly connected to left-lateralized
	phonological representations. Asymmetric damage to semantic units
	reproduced the longitudinal patient profiles of naming relative to

@article{Lemire2011,
	Abstract = {Many species of bacteria harbor multiple prophages in their genomes.
	Prophages often carry genes that confer a selective advantage to
	the bacterium, typically during host colonization. Prophages can
	convert to infectious viruses through a process known as induction,
	which is relevant to the spread of bacterial virulence genes. The
	paradigm of prophage induction, as set by the phage Lambda model,
	sees the process initiated by the RecA-stimulated self-proteolysis
	of the phage repressor. Here we show that a large family of lambdoid
	prophages found in Salmonella genomes employs an alternative induction
	strategy. The repressors of these phages are not cleaved upon induction;
	rather, they are inactivated by the binding of small antirepressor
	proteins. Formation of the complex causes the repressor to dissociate
	from DNA. The antirepressor genes lie outside the immunity region
	and are under direct control of the LexA repressor, thus plugging
	prophage induction directly into the SOS response. GfoA and GfhA,
	the antirepressors of Salmonella prophages Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-3, each
	target both of these phages' repressors, GfoR and GfhR, even though
	the latter proteins recognize different operator sites and the two
	phages are heteroimmune. In contrast, the Gifsy-2 phage repressor,
	GtgR, is insensitive to GfoA and GfhA, but is inactivated by an antirepressor
	from the unrelated Fels-1 prophage (FsoA). This response is all the
	more surprising as FsoA is under the control of the Fels-1 repressor,
	not LexA, and plays no apparent role in Fels-1 induction, which occurs
	via a Lambda CI-like repressor cleavage mechanism. The ability of
	antirepressors to recognize non-cognate repressors allows coordination
	of induction of multiple prophages in polylysogenic strains. Identification
	of non-cleavable gfoR/gtgR homologues in a large variety of bacterial
	genomes (including most Escherichia coli genomes in the DNA database)
	suggests that antirepression-mediated induction is far more common

	qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores,
	sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated

	NTS bacteremia in Malawian children, because we found this condition
	mainly occurs before 2 years of age, with relative sparing of infants
	younger than 4 months old. Sera from all healthy Malawian children
	tested aged more than 16 months contained anti-Salmonella antibody
	and successfully killed NTS. Killing was mediated by complement membrane
	attack complex and not augmented in the presence of blood leukocytes.
	Sera from most healthy children less than 16 months old lacked NTS-specific

	complement function. Addition of Salmonella-specific antibody, but
	not mannose-binding lectin, enabled NTS killing. All NTS strains
	tested had long-chain lipopolysaccharide and the rck gene, features

	Abstract = {Gram-negative bacterial ghosts produced by controlled expression of
	the plasmid-encoded lysis gene E offers a promising approach in non-living
	vaccine technology. Bacterial cell wall complex and hence the antigenic
	determinants of the living cells are not affected by denaturation
	due to cell killing. However, the endotoxin content of the Gram-negative
	cell wall has been discussed as a potential problem for this kind
	of whole cell or envelope vaccines. Here we show that bacterial ghosts
	prepared from Escherichia coli O26:B6 and Salmonella typhimurium
	C5 induce dose-dependent antibody responses against bacterial cells
	or their corresponding lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in doses 25 ng kg-1
	when administered intravenously to rabbits in a standard immunization
	protocol. No differences between the immune responses of the rabbits
	were observed when comparing equivalent doses of bacterial ghosts
	and antibiotic-treated whole cells. The results indicate that the
	bacterial ghosts exhibit all the antigenic properties of the living
	cells. No significant fever responses in rabbits have been recorded
	in doses of < 250 ng kg-1 E. coli O26:B6 ghosts and up to doses of
	250 ng kg-1 S. typhimurium C5 ghosts when applying test methods recommended
	by the US pharmacopoeia. These findings correlate with cell culture
	experiments where doses 100 ng ml-1 of bacterial ghosts were needed
	for the release of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and prostaglandin
	E2 (PGE2) from RAW mouse macrophage cultures. Free LPS of Salmonella
	abortus equi commonly used as a LPS-standard, however, stimulated
	TNF alpha and PGE2 synthesis of RAW cells in doses of 1 ng ml-1.
	The endotoxic activity of our bacterial preparations analysed by
	a standard limulus amoebocyte lysate and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate assay
	correlated with the capacity to stimulate the release of PGE2 and
	TNF alpha in RAW mouse macrophage cultures and the endotoxic responses

	used as easy predictive test systems for preparations of bacterial
	vaccines, particularly for bacterial ghosts.},

	military conducted experiments that attempted to ascertain the spread

	of both the public and the military were exposed to S. marcescens,

	pathogen by the mid-1960s. S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens have
	been isolated as causative agents of numerous outbreaks and opportunistic
	infections, and the association of these organisms with point sources
	such as medical devices and various solutions given to hospitalized

	are caused by multiply antibiotic-resistant strains of S. marcescens,

	understanding of the complex events of host cell response to microbial

	weakly. To gain insights into the mode of evolution and the functional
	range of the lncRNA, they can be compared with much better characterized
	protein-coding genes. The evolutionary rate of the protein-coding
	genes shows a universal negative correlation with expression: highly
	expressed genes are on average more conserved during evolution than
	the genes with lower expression levels. This correlation was conceptualized
	in the misfolding-driven protein evolution hypothesis according to
	which misfolding is the principal cost incurred by protein expression.
	We sought to determine whether long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs)

	Additionally, the expression level of the lincRNAs is significantly

	ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment
	conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account
	of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples
	is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with
	sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each
	gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively
	few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability.
	The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor
	project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the
	ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
	expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific
	expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow
	for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion
	across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability.
	Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results
	and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent

	are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable,

	for the discovery of biological components. Yet analysis of this
	data to identify functional RNAs lags behind efforts to characterize

	HTCC 1062 is the closest match for approximately 20% of marine metagenomic
	sequence reads. It is also small, contains little non-coding DNA,
	and has strikingly low GC content. RESULTS: To aid the discovery
	of RNA motifs within the marine metagenome we exploited the genomic
	properties of 'Cand. P. ubique' by targeting our search to long intergenic
	regions (IGRs) with relatively high GC content. Analysis of known
	RNAs (rRNA, tRNA, riboswitches etc.) shows that structured RNAs are
	significantly enriched in such IGRs. To identify additional candidate
	structured RNAs, we examined other IGRs with similar characteristics
	from 'Cand. P. ubique' using comparative genomics approaches in conjunction
	with marine metagenomic data. Employing this strategy, we discovered
	four candidate structured RNAs including a new riboswitch class as
	well as three additional likely cis-regulatory elements that precede
	genes encoding ribosomal proteins S2 and S12, and the cytoplasmic
	protein component of the signal recognition particle. We also describe
	four additional potential RNA motifs with few or no examples occurring
	outside the metagenomic data. CONCLUSION: This work begins the process
	of identifying functional RNA motifs present in the metagenomic data
	and illustrates how existing completed genomes may be used to aid

	patients in the LRYGB cohort were also required to have had a 1-year
	postoperative weight recorded. Statistical analysis was performed
	using the Student t test. RESULTS: Each cohort consisted of 40 women
	(78.4%) and 11 men (21.6%). The mean age was 48.8 +/- 8.3 years for
	the surgical cohort and 48.2 +/- 8.3 years for the conventionally
	treated cohort. The mean body mass index was 47.7 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2)
	preoperatively for the surgical cohort and 45.1 +/- 5.7 kg/m2 initially
	for the conventionally treated cohort. The mean preoperative/initial
	HbA1c was 7.5% +/- 1.4% and 7.0% +/- 1.1% for the surgical and conventionally
	treated groups, respectively. At 1 year, HbA1c results were available
	for 46 LRYGB and 41 conventionally treated patients. The corresponding
	mean HbA1c values were 5.8% +/- 1.1% and 7.0% +/- .9% (P = .001).
	At 3 years, the mean HbA1c was 6.1% +/- 1.2% and 7.8% +/- 1.5% for
	28 surgical and 36 conventionally treated patients, respectively
	(P = .001). The surgical patients' use of oral hypoglycemic medications
	and/or insulin decreased from 84.3% before surgery to 22.4% at 1
	year postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The patients who underwent LRYGB
	had a significant and sustained improvement in the HbA1c value compared

	codon boxes are decoded by a tRNA having the modified nucleoside
	uridine-5-oxyacetic acid (cmo5U) as a wobble nucleoside present in
	position 34 of the tRNA. In the proline family codon box, one (tRNAProcmo5UGG)
	of the three tRNAs that reads the four proline codons has cmo5U34.
	According to theoretical predictions and several results obtained
	in vitro, cmo5U34 should base pair with A, G, and U in the third
	position of the codon but not with C. To analyze the function of
	cmo5U34 in tRNAProcmo5UGG in vivo, we first identified two genes
	(cmoA and cmoB) involved in the synthesis of cmo5U34. The null mutation
	cmoB2 results in tRNA having 5-hydroxyuridine (ho5U34) instead of
	cmo5U34, whereas the null mutation cmoA1 results in the accumulation
	of 5-methoxyuridine (mo5U34) and ho5U34 in tRNA. The results suggest
	that the synthesis of cmo5U34 occurs as follows: U34 -->(?) ho5U
	-->(CmoB) mo5U -->(CmoA?) cmo5U. We introduced the cmoA1 or the cmoB2
	null mutations into a strain that only had tRNAProcmo5UGG and thus
	lacked the other two proline-specific tRNAs normally present in the
	cell. From analysis of growth rates of various strains and of the

	tRNAProcmo5UGG is able to read all four proline codons; (2) the presence
	of ho5U34 instead of cmo5U34 in this tRNA reduces the efficiency
	with which it reads all four codons; and (3) the fully modified nucleoside

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial transcription attenuation occurs through a variety
	of cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression in response
	to a wide range of signals. The signal-sensing structures in attenuators
	are so diverse and rapidly evolving that only a small fraction have
	been properly annotated and characterized to date. Here we apply
	a broad-spectrum detection tool in order to achieve a more complete
	view of the transcriptional attenuation complement of key bacterial
	species. RESULTS: Our protocol seeks gene families with an unusual
	frequency of 5' terminators found across multiple species. Many of
	the detected attenuators are part of annotated elements, such as
	riboswitches or T-boxes, which often operate through transcriptional
	attenuation. However, a significant fraction of candidates were not
	previously characterized in spite of their unmistakable footprint.
	We further characterized some of these new elements using sequence
	and secondary structure analysis. We also present elements that may
	control the expression of several non-homologous genes, suggesting
	co-transcription and response to common signals. An important class
	of such elements, which we called mobile attenuators, is provided
	by 3' terminators of insertion sequences or prophages that may be
	exapted as 5' regulators when inserted directly upstream of a cellular

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current research suggests that protein intake of 1.5 -
	2.8 g/kg/day (3.5 times the current recommended daily allowance)
	is effective and safe for individuals trying to increase or maintain
	lean muscle mass. To achieve these levels of daily protein consumption,
	supplementing the diet with processed whey protein concentrate (WPC)
	in liquid form has become a popular choice for many people. Some
	products have a suggested serving size as high as 50 g of protein.
	However, due to possible inhibition of endogenous digestive enzymes
	from over-processing and rapid small intestine transit time, the
	average amount of liquid WPC that is absorbed may be only 15 g. The
	combined effect of these factors may contribute to incomplete digestion,
	thereby limiting the absorption rate of protein before it reaches
	the ceacum and is eliminated as waste. The purpose of this study
	was to determine if Aminogen(R), a patented blend of digestive proteases
	from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae, would significantly
	increase the in-vivo absorption rate of processed WPC over control
	values. It also investigated if any increase would be sufficient
	to significantly alter nitrogen (N2) balance and C-reactive protein
	(CRP) levels over control values as further evidence of increased
	WPC absorption rate. METHODS: Two groups of healthy male subjects
	were assigned a specified balanced diet before and after each of
	two legs of the study. Subjects served as their own controls. In
	the first leg each control group (CG) was dosed with 50 g of WPC
	following an overnight fast. Nine days later each test group (TG)
	was dosed following an overnight fast with 50 g of WPC containing
	either 2.5 g (A2.5) or 5 g (A5) of Aminogen(R). Blood samples were
	collected during each leg at 0 hr, 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 3.5
	hr and 4 hr for amino acid (AA) and CRP analyses. The following 18
	AAs were quantified: alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, cysteine,
	glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
	phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and
	valine. Urine was collected for 24 hours from 0 hr for total N2 analysis.
	Results are expressed as means +/- SEM. All significance and power
	testing on results was done at a level of alpha = 0.05. Area under
	the concentration time curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal
	rule. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA-1) was done between CGs,
	between TGs and between time points. One-way repeated measures analysis
	of variance (ANOVA-1-RM) was done to compare CGs and TGs. Two-way
	analysis of variance (ANOVA-2) was performed on total serum amino
	acid (TSAA) levels, urine N2 levels and CRP levels between each CG
	and TG. RESULTS: After baseline subtraction the mean AUC was significantly
	(p </= 0.05) greater in each TG compared the corresponding CG. Comparison
	of the mean AUC between each TG and each CG was not significantly
	different. Total serum amino acid (TSAA) levels were significantly
	greater in each TG compared the corresponding CG. They were also
	significantly different between each TG but not between each CG.
	All individual serum amino acid (ISAA) levels in TG-A2.5 except glycine,
	histidine, methionine and serine were significantly higher than in
	CG-A2.5 at 4 hr. All ISAA levels in TG-A5 except methionine and serine
	were significantly higher than in CG-A5 at 4 hr. The N2 balance was
	significantly higher in each TG compared to the corresponding CG,
	but not significantly different between each CG and between each
	TG. Significant differences in CRP levels are reported between each
	TG compared to the corresponding CG, but not significantly different
	between each TG and between each CG. CONCLUSION: A patented blend
	of digestive proteases (Aminogen(R)) increased the absorption rate
	of processed WPC over controls, as measured by statistically significant
	increases in AUC, TSAA levels, ISAA levels and N2 balance. Significant
	decreases in CRP levels and fluxes in AA levels are also reported.},

	effects of iron availability in S. flexneri. These assays showed
	that the expression of genes involved in iron acquisition and acid
	response was induced by low-iron availability and by inactivation
	of fur. A fur null mutant was acid sensitive in media at pH 2.5,
	and acid sensitivity was also observed in the wild-type strain grown

	Abstract = {For most living organisms, iron is both essential and potentially
	toxic, making the precise maintenance of iron homeostasis necessary
	for survival. To manage this paradox, bacteria regulate the acquisition,
	utilization, and storage of iron in response to its availability.
	The iron-dependent ferric uptake repressor (Fur) often mediates this
	iron-responsive regulation by both direct and indirect mechanisms.
	In 2002, Masse and Gottesman identified a novel target of Fur-mediated
	regulation in Escherichia coli: a gene encoding a small regulatory
	RNA (sRNA) termed RyhB. Under conditions of iron-limitation, RyhB
	is produced and functions to regulate the expression of several target
	genes encoding iron-utilizing enzymes, iron acquisition systems,
	and iron storage factors. This pivotal finding provided the missing
	link between environmental iron-limitation and previously observed
	decreases in certain iron-dependent metabolic pathways, a phenomenon
	now referred to as an "iron-sparing" response. The discovery of RyhB
	opened the door to the rapidly expanding field of bacterial iron-regulated
	sRNAs, which continue to be identified and described in numerous
	bacterial species. Most striking are findings that the impact of
	iron-responsive sRNA regulation often extends beyond iron homeostasis,
	particularly with regard to production of virulence-associated factors
	by pathogenic bacteria. This review discusses trends in the collective
	body of work on iron-regulated sRNAs, highlighting both the regulatory
	mechanisms they utilize to control target gene expression and the
	impact of this regulation on basic processes controlling bacterial
	physiology and virulence.},

	Abstract = {Ribonuclease P (RNase P) contains a catalytic RNA that cleaves precursor
	tRNA (pre-tRNA) to form the mature 5'-end of tRNA. Previous kinetic
	analyses with mutant pre-tRNAs indicated that both C residues of
	the invariant 3'-terminal CCA form specific interactions with RNase
	P RNA that contribute to the energetics of substrate binding (1,
	2). In the present study, we have used single-turnover kinetic analysis
	to investigate whether specific changes in the 3'-terminal CCA influence
	the rate of the chemical step through which enzyme-bound substrate
	is converted to product (k2). At optimal ionic strength (1.0 M NH4Cl,
	25 mM MgCl2), deletion or substitution of the 3'-proximal C residue
	(CCA) reduced the rate of the chemical step of cleavage (k2) by 60-fold.
	Similar changes to the 5'-proximal C residue (CCA) or the 3'-terminal
	A residue (CCA) reduced k2 only a few fold. Each mutant substrate
	exhibited weakened affinity for Mg2+, as measured by Hill plots,
	and the severity of these defects correlated with the observed reductions
	in k2. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of Mg2+ partially, but
	not completely, suppress the k2 defects caused by deletion or substitution
	of the 3'-proximal C residue. We conclude that the 3'-CCA of pre-tRNA,

	a new evolutionary alignment modeler, called "Ortheus," for inferring
	the evolutionary history of a multiple alignment, in terms of both
	substitutions and, importantly, insertions and deletions. Based on
	a multiple sequence probabilistic transducer model of the type proposed

	that significant proportions of errors due to insertions and deletions
	can be avoided by not assuming a fixed alignment. We additionally
	use a challenging hold-out cross-validation procedure to test the

	In S. enterica serovar Typhi, viaB is encoded on a 134-kb pathogenicity
	island known as SPI-7 that is located between partially duplicated
	tRNA(pheU) sites. Functional and bioinformatic analysis suggests
	that SPI-7 has a mosaic structure and may have evolved as a consequence
	of several independent insertion events. Analysis of viaB-associated
	DNA in Vi-positive S. enterica serovar Paratyphi C and S. enterica
	serovar Dublin isolates revealed the presence of similar SPI-7 islands.
	In S. enterica serovars Paratyphi C and Dublin, the SopE bacteriophage

	absent. In S. enterica serovar Paratyphi C only, a region encoding

	nucleotide-excision-repair uvrB gene, and chlorate-resistance genes.
	Beyond this, the size of the deletions and the number and type of

	have used genomic hybridization to a Typhimurium microarray to characterize
	these five DeltauvrB deletions. The number of genes (and amount of

	TA97 and TA104, 47 (50kb) in TA100, 87 (96kb) in TA1537, and 119
	(125kb) in TA98, accounting for 0.3, 0.3, 1.0, 1.9, and 2.6% of the

	regulate mRNA targets via post-transcriptional base pair interactions.
	We determined features that discriminate functional from non-functional
	interactions and assessed the influence of these features on genome-wide
	target predictions. For this purpose, we compiled a set of 71 experimentally
	verified sRNA-target pairs from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica.
	Furthermore, we collected full-length 5' untranslated regions by
	using genome-wide experimentally verified transcription start sites.
	Only interaction sites in sRNAs, but not in targets, show significant
	sequence conservation. In addition to this observation, we found
	that the base pairing between sRNAs and their targets is not conserved
	in general across more distantly related species. A closer inspection

	complementarity is only conserved in a small subset of the targets.
	In contrast to conservation, accessibility of functional interaction
	sites is significantly higher in both sRNAs and targets in comparison

	function without ever producing proteins. Noncoding RNA gene sequences
	do not have strong statistical signals, unlike protein coding genes.
	A reliable general purpose computational genefinder for noncoding
	RNA genes has been elusive. RESULTS: We describe a comparative sequence
	analysis algorithm for detecting novel structural RNA genes. The
	key idea is to test the pattern of substitutions observed in a pairwise
	alignment of two homologous sequences. A conserved coding region
	tends to show a pattern of synonymous substitutions, whereas a conserved
	structural RNA tends to show a pattern of compensatory mutations
	consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. We formalize
	this intuition using three probabilistic "pair-grammars": a pair
	stochastic context free grammar modeling alignments constrained by
	structural RNA evolution, a pair hidden Markov model modeling alignments

	of melanogenesis has been closely associated with the 6BH4 dependent
	phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and tyrosine hydroxylase isoform
	I (THI) providing evidence for an old concept of the three enzyme
	theory in the initiation of the pigmentation process. In this context,
	it is noteworthy that intracellular L-phenylalanine uptake and turnover
	to L-tyrosine via PAH is vital for substrate supply of THI and tyrosinase.
	While PAH acts in the cytosol of melanocytes, THI and tyrosinase
	are sitting side by side in the melanosomal membrane. THI at low
	pH provides L-3,4-hydroxyphenylalanine L-DOPA which in turn is required
	for activation of met-tyrosinase. After an intramelanosomal pH change,

	(LV) geometry, carotid structure and arterial compliance in relation
	to hemodynamic stimuli and risk factors (plasma cholesterol, body
	mass index, insulin resistance, smoking habit, age, sex and race).
	DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Echocardiography and carotid ultrasound
	were performed in 2375 elderly subjects without signs or history
	of prevalent cardiovascular disease, diabetes or renal disease (795
	men; 298 non-whites; 1215 hypertensive), from the cohort of the Cardiovascular
	Health Study. Arterial compliance was estimated by the prognostically
	validated ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure (SV/PP) as the
	percent deviation (Delta%) from the value predicted by individual
	age, heart rate and body weight. RESULTS: Intima-medial thickness
	(IMT) was higher in the presence of LV hypertrophy (LVH) in normotensive
	and hypertensive subjects and was greatest in the presence of concentric
	LVH. Maximum carotid lumen diameter (CLD) was also higher in the
	presence of LVH (and was greatest with eccentric LVH, in association
	with relatively high values for stroke volume). After adjusting for
	blood pressure, maximum carotid lumen diameter was directly correlated
	with stroke volume, and IMT to LV mass (all P < 0.001). Similarly,
	IMT was also related to maximum carotid lumen diameter, independently
	of prevalent risk factors (P < 0.001). SV/PP-Delta% was reduced in
	both groups with concentric LV remodeling (both P < 0.0001) or concentric
	LVH (both P < 0.05). Adjusting for risk factors did not affect these
	associations in normotensives, but made them insignificant in hypertensives.
	In normotensives, IMT was inversely related to SV/PP-Delta% (P <
	0.001), independently of risk factors, whereas no significant relation
	was found in hypertensives. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitudes of carotid
	intima-medial thickness and lumen diameter parallel levels of LV
	mass and geometry, and are directly related to stroke volume and
	arterial stiffness; this interaction is most evident in the presence
	of normal blood pressure, whereas it is affected by other cardiovascular

	Subsequent HTPS analysis of 350,000 cDNAs, derived from RNA co-immunoprecipitation

	that are Hfq-bound in vivo. The cDNA analysis discovered new, small

	is known about the evolutionary dynamics of bacterial sRNAs. Here,
	we apply phylogenetic and network analyses to investigate the evolutionary
	processes and principles that govern sRNA gene distribution in 27

	genomes) and variable sRNAs; more than two-thirds of the E. coli
	K-12 MG1655 sRNAs are core, whereas the others show patterns of presence
	and absence that are principally due to genetic loss, not duplication
	or lateral genetic transfer. We present evidence that variable sRNAs
	are less tightly integrated into cellular genetic regulatory networks
	than are the core sRNAs, and that Hfq facilitates posttranscriptional
	cross talk between the E. coli-Shigella core and variable genomes.
	Finally, we present evidence that more than 80% of genes targeted

	model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for
	general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments

	microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived
	for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have
	robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete
	data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior
	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the

	the functions of the paracellular barrier of gastric surface epithelium,
	SS1, a strain of H. pylori adapted to the murine stomach, was inoculated

	Abstract = {Salmonella species are enterobacterial pathogens that have been exceptionally
	well investigated with respect to virulence mechanisms, microbial
	pathogenesis, genome evolution and many fundamental pathways of gene
	expression and metabolism. While these studies have traditionally
	focused on protein functions, Salmonella has also become a model
	organism for RNA-mediated regulation. The present review is dedicated
	to the non-coding RNA world of Salmonella: it covers small RNAs (sRNAs)
	that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, novel
	Salmonella cis-regulatory RNA elements that sense metabolite and
	metal ion concentrations (or temperature), and globally acting RNA-binding
	proteins such as CsrA or Hfq (inactivation of which cause drastic
	phenotypes and virulence defects). Owing to mosaic genome structure,
	some of the Salmonella sRNAs are widely conserved in bacteria whereas
	others are very specific to Salmonella species. Intriguingly, sRNAs
	of either type (CsrB/C, InvR, SgrS) facilitate cross-talk between
	the Salmonella core genome and its laterally acquired virulence regions.
	Work in Salmonella also identified physiological functions (and mechanisms
	thereof) of RNA that had remained unknown in Escherichia coli, and
	pioneered the use of high-throughput sequencing technology to identify
	the sRNA and mRNA targets of bacterial RNA-binding proteins.},

	Abstract = {Recent bioinformatics-aided searches have identified many new small
	RNAs (sRNAs) in the intergenic regions of the bacterium Escherichia
	coli. Here, a shot-gun cloning approach (RNomics) was used to generate
	cDNA libraries of small sized RNAs. Besides many of the known sRNAs,
	we found new species that were not predicted previously. The present
	work brings the number of sRNAs in E.coli to 62. Experimental transcription
	start site mapping showed that some sRNAs were encoded from independent
	genes, while others were processed from mRNA leaders or trailers,
	indicative of a parallel transcriptional output generating sRNAs
	co-expressed with mRNAs. Two of these RNAs (SroA and SroG) consist
	of known (THI and RFN) riboswitch elements. We also show that two
	recently identified sRNAs (RyeB and SraC/RyeA) interact, resulting
	in RNase III-dependent cleavage. To the best of our knowledge, this
	represents the first case of two non-coding RNAs interacting by a
	putative antisense mechanism. In addition, intracellular metabolic
	stabilities of sRNAs were determined, including ones from previous
	screens. The wide range of half-lives (<2 to >32 min) indicates that

	we determined that Cox-II is not expressed in 70 benign and malignant
	melanocytic tumours. Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell
	carcinomas (SCCs) were also analysed as controls: the BCCs were consistently
	Cox-II negative (n = 11), whereas the SCCs showed moderate to strong
	Cox-II expression in 53% (n = 17). Reverse transcription-polymerase
	chain reaction and Western blotting of MM cell lines and MM tissues
	confirmed the lack of Cox-II expression in MM. However, in vitro
	the Cox-inhibiting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac

	and comparative genomic hybridization, but these methods examine
	only very limited regions or limited mapping resolution of the tumor
	genome. In this study, we used DNA microarray assay, which detects
	numerous genetic abnormalities simultaneously and analyses a global

	aberrations and genetic abnormalities in the whole genome. RESULTS:
	This study demonstrated not only classical chromosomal aberration,
	such as loss of chromosome 22q in 19 meningiomas (61.3%), but also
	new genetic characteristics of meningiomas, such as amplification
	of MSH2 in 16 meningiomas (51.6%), deletion of GSCL in 13 meningiomas

	Abstract = {Serratia sp. ATCC 39006 (S39006) is a Gram-negative bacterium that
	is virulent in plant (potato) and animal (Caenorhabditis elegans)
	models. It produces two secondary metabolite antibiotics, a prodigiosin
	and a carbapenem, and the exoenzymes, pectate lyase and cellulase.
	A complex regulatory network that includes quorum sensing (QS) controls
	production of prodigiosin. While many aspects of the regulation of
	the metabolites and exoenzymes are well understood, the potential
	role in this network of the RNA chaperone Hfq and dependent small
	regulatory RNAs has not been characterized. Hfq is an RNA chaperone
	involved in post-transcriptional regulation that plays a key role
	in stress response and virulence in diverse bacterial species. To
	explore whether Hfq-dependent processes might contribute to the regulation
	of antibiotic production we constructed an S39006 Deltahfq mutant.
	Production of prodigiosin and carbapenem was abolished in this mutant
	strain, while production of the QS signalling molecule, butanoyl
	homoserine lactone (BHL), was unaffected. Using transcriptional fusions,
	we found that Hfq regulates the QS response regulators, SmaR and
	CarR. Additionally, exoenzyme production and swimming motility were
	decreased in a Deltahfq mutant, and virulence was attenuated in potato
	and C. elegans models. These results suggest that an Hfq-dependent
	pathway is involved in the regulation of virulence and secondary

@article{Winston2011,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since 1953, through the cooperation of state and local
	health departments, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
	(CDC) has collected information on incident cases of tuberculosis
	(TB) disease in the United States. In 2009, TB case rates declined
	-11.4%, compared to an average annual -3.8% decline since 2000. The
	unexpectedly large decline raised concerns that TB cases may have
	gone unreported. To address the unexpected decline, we examined trends
	from multiple sources on TB treatment initiation, medication sales,
	and laboratory and genotyping data on culture-positive TB. METHODS:
	We analyzed 142,174 incident TB cases reported to the U. S. National
	Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) during January 1, 2000-December
	31, 2009; TB control program data from 59 public health reporting
	areas; self-reported data from 50 CDC-funded public health laboratories;
	monthly electronic prescription claims for new TB therapy prescriptions;
	and complete genotyping results available for NTSS cases. Accounting
	for prior trends using regression and time-series analyses, we calculated
	the deviation between observed and expected TB cases in 2009 according
	to patient and clinical characteristics, and assessed at what point
	in time the deviation occurred. RESULTS: The overall deviation in
	TB cases in 2009 was -7.9%, with -994 fewer cases reported than expected
	(P < .001). We ruled out evidence of surveillance underreporting
	since declines were seen in states that used new software for case
	reporting in 2009 as well as states that did not, and we found no
	cases unreported to CDC in our examination of over 5400 individual
	line-listed reports in 11 areas. TB cases decreased substantially
	among both foreign-born and U.S.-born persons. The unexpected decline
	began in late 2008 or early 2009, and may have begun to reverse in
	late 2009. The decline was greater in terms of case counts among
	foreign-born than U.S.-born persons; among the foreign-born, the
	declines were greatest in terms of percentage deviation from expected
	among persons who had been in the United States less than 2 years.
	Among U.S.-born persons, the declines in percentage deviation from
	expected were greatest among homeless persons and substance users.
	Independent information systems (NTSS, TB prescription claims, and
	public health laboratories) reported similar patterns of declines.
	Genotyping data did not suggest sudden decreases in recent transmission.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our assessments show that the decline in reported TB
	was not an artifact of changes in surveillance methods; rather, similar
	declines were found through multiple data sources. While the steady
	decline of TB cases before 2009 suggests ongoing improvement in TB
	control, we were not able to identify any substantial change in TB
	control activities or TB transmission that would account for the
	abrupt decline in 2009. It is possible that other multiple causes
	coincident with economic recession in the United States, including
	decreased immigration and delayed access to medical care, could be
	related to TB declines. Our findings underscore important needs in
	addressing health disparities as we move towards TB elimination in
	the United States.},

	Abstract = {Hfq, a bacterial member of the Sm family of RNA-binding proteins,
	is required for the action of many small regulatory RNAs that act
	by basepairing with target mRNAs. Hfq binds this family of small
	RNAs efficiently. We have used co-immunoprecipitation with Hfq and
	direct detection of the bound RNAs on genomic microarrays to identify
	members of this small RNA family. This approach was extremely sensitive;
	even Hfq-binding small RNAs expressed at low levels were readily
	detected. At least 15 of 46 known small RNAs in E. coli interact
	with Hfq. In addition, high signals in other intergenic regions suggested
	up to 20 previously unidentified small RNAs bind Hfq; five were confirmed
	by Northern analysis. Strong signals within genes and operons also
	were detected, some of which correspond to known Hfq targets. Within
	the argX-hisR-leuT-proM operon, Hfq appears to compete with RNase
	E and modulate RNA processing and degradation. Thus Hfq immunoprecipitation
	followed by microarray analysis is a highly effective method for
	detecting a major class of small RNAs as well as identifying new

	The objective of this study was to evaluate different procedures

	Typhimurium was isolated from two cake mix samples; the food isolates
	were indistinguishable from the outbreak pattern by pulsed-field
	gel electrophoresis subtyping. Universal preenrichment broth was
	substantially better than was lactose broth for preenrichment, and
	tetrathionate broth was better than was Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth
	for isolating Salmonella from the two positive cake mix samples.
	Although more typical Salmonella colonies were observed on plates

	II, DNA-mediated elements. One of these transposons, Himar1 , isolated
	from the horn fly, is independent of host-specific factors that would
	limit transfer between different species, making it an ideal candidate
	for gene transfer technology development. To determine the activity
	of Himar1 transposase in mammalian cells, we introduced the Himar1
	transposase gene into an adenovirus (Ad) vector under control of
	the phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Mammalian cells infected with
	the Ad vector carrying the Himar1 gene efficiently expressed the
	Himar1 transposase in the presence of T7 polymerase. In in vitro
	inter-plasmid transposition reactions, Himar1 transposase expressed
	by the Ad vector mediated precise cut-and-paste transposition and
	resulted in a characteristic duplication of TA at the integration
	site of the target plasmid. Further studies showed that this transposase
	was capable of catalyzing transposition between twoplasmids co-transfected
	into 293T7pol cells, which express T7 RNA polymerase. Combining the
