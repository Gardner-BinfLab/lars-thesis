I have been tremendously fortunate to spend the past four years on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus at the Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute. I would like to thank foremost my main collaborators on the studies described in this thesis: Paul Gardner and Gemma Langridge. Their contributions and support have been invaluable. I would also like to thank my supervisor, Alex Bateman, for giving me the freedom to pursue a wide range of projects during my time in his group and for advice. Many others have influenced my thinking through collaborations and discussions; in no particular order: Amy Cain, Christine Boinett, Oscar Westesson (UC Berkeley), Ian Holmes (UC Berkeley), Leo Parts, Zasha Weinberg (Yale University/HHMI), Nick Thomson, Julian Parkhill, Chinyere Okoro, Sandra Reuter, Nick Croucher, Thomas Dan Otto, Simon Harris, Rob Kingsley, Melissa Martin (London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine), John Wain (University of East Anglia), Theresa Feltwell, Helena Seth-Smith, Eric Nawrocki (Janelia Farm Research Campus), Sean Eddy (Janelia Farm Research Campus), Anton Enright, Marija Buljan, Derek Pickard, Marco Punta, Fabian Schreiber, Sarah Burge, John Marioni, Keith Turner, and Nick Feasey. I am sure I have forgotten still more who deserve my thanks. Finally, I would like to especially thank Joanne Chung and Gomi Jung.
