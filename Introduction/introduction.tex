Bacteria possess a remarkable ability to adapt. This ability has allowed bacteria colonize almost every environ on Earth, from deep sea hydrothermal vents \parencite{Jorgensen1992} to cryogenic brine lakes \parencite{Murray2012} to animal hosts \parencite{Finlay1997}. Indeed, the ability of bacteria to establish a symbiotic relationship with host cells was an essential step in the origin of so-called ``higher" eukaryotic life \parencite{Sagan1967}.
